<h1>Where it all started</h1>
<section>

<p>Ever heard of hypnosis? yes it exists and way beyond that men can control a woman's brain somehow and it is not only a one man project but its a cult they form a group targeting Christian women and men turning them against God and themselves just how the serpent did when adam and eve were first created i got into a lot of trouble before starting to write this book. before it was all about love and how God saved my life and how amazing someone who stabbed me several times in the back i thought was but he turned out to be the worst enemy any lover could ever have this story doesn't seem like a lovey dovey as the page layout and design seems to be not how i imagined it to be but still it does include God and how he offers love and grace to the worst of all people i was led into believing that i was bad person and my deeds were completely wrong by those i thought loved me but, in contrast they turned out to be the ones who were the reason for my downfall. i don't know if my story was supposed to go this way or who decided to put an end to the pain and downfall or their evil schemes that everyone against God and me. one family in USA i met showed me the truth on how a person can be controlled or manipulated were they good or bad? God knows, i have been threatened and my hand broken on purpose by the guy i trusted and who acted like he was my protector all because my light shined brighter in those deceiving eyes. </p>

<p> God was there all along correcting their wrongs and my wrongs healing me every day and loving me enough that i found a way out well, not completely but still i have one more demon to defeat. by the end of writing this book, I will be showing you guys how God can change someone. I happened to be called an attention seeker and the worse. just when I stopped being a slave to the enemies. the guy who started this made me believe that I loved him and that he loved me. i never loved him and i still cant figure out how i happened to get into a relationship with him, he came to church with me, pretended he loved me and accepted me, and gave me gifts. The first gift he ever gave me was a cross. which led me to believe that he was a good person. right in front of my eyes, he flirted with other girls and used hypnosis, and made me believe that he was a good person. His exact words were "whatever you believed until now, forget everything, I am not that person anymore, I am a good guy."</p>

<p>And I believed it. i didn't realize it then, but when few other people used the same dialogue using numbers and walking to and FRO to have me in their grip and later someone breaking it to me the same people i was talking about in the previous paragraph. i wish i knew who it was every second, but I surely know it was God's work. I was just simply uncontrollable till the end or i would have ended up in the worst situation one can ever be i give all the credit to God.
  A used to ask me questions about faith, hated on the preacher that we went to church, and said he says things to oppress their religion when I just now realized the preacher was way ahead of time as  i was. he saw their true colors and had enough guts to speak about them. He said it out loud, and many people hated that he warned us, and even churches went against him because his light was shining brighter than their bald heads. the person who changed my life, the one on my front page, called me funny and loved my humor. So I am going to make the best out of it and use my humor, so it might make it more interesting to read. FACT: This is a real story. </p>

<p>So, where should i begin? My mom and dad fell in love when they were young. My mom had beautiful long hair, she was the most beautiful woman so was my dad, eventually God brought them together, parents agreed but, mom was already set up with another guy and so was dad, my dads mom was against it but somehow she still agreed my moms side didnt hesitate because they knew my mom deserved a nice guy, well, they got engaged and somehow months later my grandmother went into some trans one which i now understand as both the workers at her brothers place and our place were from different religion they spread stories and started rumors that my mom and her side were casting spells to get them married and my grandmother became a victim to that it was humiliating for a girl to get her wedding cancelled after the engagement and my Dad was graceful enough to marry my mom despite everything, probably he knew what it was or maybe he didnt but God surely hadnt given up on them. they got married went home my grandmother got furious, and my mother was traumatized. She didn't know what she did wrong, nor did my nanamma. My grandmother was a believer a true one she led her sons in christ, she donated all that she had to the church after my grandfather had died, not to brag, but he was the sweetest person alive. i still remember when he took me to an arcade, the mickey mouse i sat on even my father insisted on not taking me he never listened, now that i think about it, if they were still alive my life wouldnt be this bad, he tried to convince everyone but i guess he failed. he died of an heartattack when i was 5 years old i think.. at a wedding i can now imagine how much regret and pain he had carried both his sons in america him having fights with his family on property issues and his beloved son getting married but not in front of his eyes. i can totally imagine everyones pain, "it is true when they said be careful what you wish for" for i kept asking God too many question like why ? what ? how? and for too much wisdom that now people think im crazy??? but yeah all the best people were wronged. All the victims have been silenced all the fighters abolished or murdered because they knew too much so i am playing it safe. </p>
